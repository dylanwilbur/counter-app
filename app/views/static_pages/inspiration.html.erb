          The idea was inspired by our 10th grade english teacher when she was introducing
          our unit on the holocaust and the works of Elie Wiesel. We were instructed to
          enter the enormous numbers of people killed in each country, helping us to
          fully appreciate the enormity of those numbers. Although the excersize helped
          us to get a grasp on the idea, there was still a <b>natural disconnect to the 
          massive loss of human life</b>, as it is difficult to process such loss all at once.
